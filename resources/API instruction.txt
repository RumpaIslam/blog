Install via composer
Run the following command to pull in the latest version:

		composer require tymon/jwt-auth



Add service provider
Add the service provider to the providers array in the config/app.php config file as follows:


		'providers' => [

  		  ...

 			   Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider::class,
		]



Publish the config
Run the following command to publish the package config file:

		php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider"


You should now have a config/jwt.php file that allows you to configure the basics of this package.

Generate secret key
I have included a helper command to generate a key for you:


		php artisan jwt:secret



This will update your .env file with something like JWT_SECRET=foobar

It is the key that will be used to sign your tokens. How that happens exactly will depend on the algorithm that you choose to use.

In config/auth.php

'defaults' => [
        'guard' => 'api',     //alternat web to api.
        'passwords' => 'users',
    ],



'guards' => [
        'web' => [
            'driver' => 'session',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],

        'api' => [
            'driver' => 'jwt',    //alternat token to jwt
            'provider' => 'users',
            'hash' => false,
        ],
    ],
